Use case picked: 1

Algoritm best fit for use case: Polynomial Regression.

# Why did i choose this algorithm?

Due to the nature of the use-case, i need to be able to predict a price from the given input. classification isn't really fit for this since it's more used for feature recognition to identify and classify images, whereas regression is more fit for predicting stock prices since we are trying to predict a continous value. as for the reason i chose polynomial regression is because stock prices vary heavily, and do not follow a linear graph.
